<h1> What Happens If A Candidate Fails To Accept/Reject Admission Offer On JAMB's CAPS</h1> <hr>
<p>
The responsibility of every UTME candidate is to either accept or reject his admission when offered on 
Jamb CAPS. But in a situation where such candidate fails to do so, due to his negligence or ignorance, 
these may happen:<br><br>
1.The admission offer may be revoked: This is because a candidate offered admission is said to either 
accept or reject the offer within a certain period. Though Jamb may later reconsider him after they have 
absolutely done with the admission process of the particular year, it would be late and such candidate 
won’t meet up with his institution academic calendar.<br><br>
In 2019, Unilorin and many institutions had nearly started conducting tests (academic tests) for the 
newly admitted candidates of the year before the names of candidates who were unable to accept their 
admission offers on CAPS were published by Jamb, and were asked to either accept or reject the offers.
Those candidates had no choice than to reject/leave the offers, since they had already missed many 
lectures which might be hard for them to meet up. So, if you really need admission, stay informed.<br><br>
2. The candidate won’t be considered for admission in other institutions: when a candidate happens to 
reject his admission offer, he will be made available to other institutions who are in need of students, 
otherwise he won’t be considered for admission. Such candidate will need to stay home for another 
365days.<br><br>
This will be explained further in the next page.
