    About
  </div><br>
  <p>
    This website is aim to help students seeking admissions into Nigerian tertiary institutions by excelling in the major entrance examinations(UTME, Post-UTME).<br><br>
    To pass the UTME has become a principal obstacle for many Nigerian students. Many students 
do stay home up to one, two or more years battling with UTME after their graduations from 
secondary schools. Some even enroll themselves in tutorial classes and still end up scoring below 
their courses cut-off marks. <br><br>
Another problem these students face is that after passing the examination, and have higher marks in 
the Post-UTME, some of them are still being denied admissions.<br><br>
What do you think is causing these problems? Can you figure it out? Don’t worry! I have penned on this website,
how a candidate can pass his JAMB’s UTME in flying colors, and noted some things that may/will 
deny them admissions despite having higher marks (scoring above their courses cut-off marks) in JAMB’s UTME and Post UTME respectively. <br><br>
All vital things a candidate (UTME/DE) seeking admission needs to know about admission processing 
into Nigeria tertiary institutions have been discussed on this educative website, including tips to score 
higher marks in the UTME. <br><br>
I hope it benefit you.
