  <h1>Introduction To Four Major Admission Requirements That May 
Automatically Get A Candidate Disqualified If Not Fulfilled</h1><hr><p>
If you’re among candidates who are being denied admissions despite having higher marks in UTME and 
Post UTME, read this carefully. You might see one or more things you’ve been doing wrong.<br><br>
1. UTME Subject Combinations:<br><br>
This is where some students make mistakes. Every course has its core subjects. Wrong 
selection of subjects leads to automatic disqualification. Try as much as possible to pick the 
perfect subjects for your course to avoid future depression. You can make use of JAMB 
brochure.
Also, bear it on mind that no matter higher your score is, the moment it’s spotted that you’re choosing 
wrong subjects for your desired course, you may be disqualified or given another course.<br><br>
2. Results Uploading:<br><br>
Uploading of your result (O’level or A’level) plays a vital role in processing your admission. 
That’s why JAMB always rings it to the ears of candidates to upload their results on JAMB 
CAPS, and failure to do so will also lead to automatic disqualification, no matter how higher 
your JAMB or post UTME score is.
There are many candidates who merit admission but their negligence and ignorance are their principal 
obstacles. Many candidates merit admissions but this single thing (not uploading their results on CAPS) 
denies them their victories.
However, if you’re reading this as a Jambite and never uploaded your result, quickly do so as soon as 
possible. Mind you, use good result.<br><br>
3 JAMB Score:<br><br>
It’s a must for any candidate who is using UTME as his mode of entry to sit for Jamb exam 
(UTME). After a candidate sat for the examination (UTME) organized by the board, and 
violated no examination rule, his score will be released by the board. But if he violated the 
examination rules, his result I’ll be withheld, and if not released, he has lost the admission of 
the particular year.<br><br>
However, let say the higher the score the higher your chances of getting admitted, and the lower the 
score the lower your chances of getting admitted. Though you may be aspiring for a less competitive 
course, try as much as possible to score higher.<br><br>
4 Post UTME Score:<br><br>
This is where many candidates who meet the aforementioned requirements get disqualified 
from the admission race. This is because many candidates relent after scoring higher in 
UTME which as the result may lead to their poor performances in the final exam (post 
UTME). <br><br>
Some 2020 aspirants of University of Ibadan who had 280 above as their UTME scores were disqualified 
from admission race by the institution because they weren’t able to score at least 50% in their post 
UTME. 
Mind you, you can’t fulfill one of the requirements and leave the rest. You must meet all the 
requirements mentioned in this article before you can be considered for admission in any University, 
especially, the federal owned ones within the country.
Your post UTME score is as important as your subject combination, results and JAMB score respectively.<br><br>
So, do yourself a favor.</p></div>
