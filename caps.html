  <h1>Understanding Caps: Meaning And How It Works</h1> <hr>

<p>CAPS is an acronym of Central Admission Processing System, launched by JAMB to eradicate admission corruption. Jamb admits any candidate seeking admission into a tertiary institution via this system. According to the body, a candidate’s admission is foiled if he isn’t admitted on caps but only on institution portal. So, before you rejoice over your admission, make sure you have been offered admission on caps, and printed your admission letter.<br> <br>

 Accessing Caps: How A Candidate Can Accept/Reject Admission Offer On Caps, Or Check Credentials (Step-By-Step Guide) Below are step-by-step guides on how a candidate can access his Jamb’s caps to either accept/reject his admission offer or check credentials:
<br><br>
1. Look for a good browser, the recommended ones by JAMB are Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
<br><br>
2. Open your browser and go to JAMB site, but before you login, click on the three dots if you’re using Firefox(for Chrome it’s the same but sometimes turns to red) at the top right corner of your browser and select “Request desktop site” from the drop down. When the page pops up, enter your details and login.
<br><br>
3. Click on the “Check Admission Status” on the popped up page.
<br><br>
4. On the next page, enter your JAMB registration number, and click on “Access My Caps”, then it’ll take you to the last page. On the last page, you’ll see different options, like: Check Admission Status, My O’level Result, etc. Just click on anyone you want prior to the operation you want to perform. If you click on “My O’level” to view your result and you can’t see it there, go for re-uploading.
