  <h1>Tips To Score Higher Marks In JAMB's UTME</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    ➢ DOWNLOAD JAMB SYLLABUS FOR YOUR UTME SUBJECTS
<br><br>
As an admission seeker into the university, there is no rest for you until your dream to be in the higher

institution of learning comes true. In this regard, all efforts to make you excel in the UTME and PUTME 
must be exalted. <br><br>
However, to make this easy and possible, the body responsible for the conduction of the UTME, JAMB 
has made it its responsibility to be releasing syllabus for every subject yearly in order to make the 
candidates know the particular topics the UTME questions will be set from and consequently read them 
accordingly.
 
To have the syllabus, follow the link https://jamb.gov.ng/ibass or send us a 
message via our email address. <br><br>
 
➢ HAVE A TIMETABLE FOR EACH SUBJECT
 <br><br>
After downloading the syllabus for your UTME subject combinations, you need to set a timetable for 
yourself to make the study easier for you. How to structure your timetable, you can schedule one month 
to cover the four UTME subjects. Read each subject for one week without interruption. Dedicate at least 
four hours (2hrs/morning and 2hrs/Afternoon or Night) for reading every day. But if you’re having lesser 
than a month, you can reduce your studying days for each subject. <br><br>
Assuming you read English language today, you’ll read it for a whole week without taking another 
subject. After a week, you’ll take another subject and do the same. That’s how you’ll be doing it until 
you’re done with all subjects. If you’re reading English language and you miss a day, never add that day, 
keep reading and take another subject when each week elapses. After you’re done with every subject 
and you still have time to read before the examination, take your books and add the days you’ve missed 
to each of the subjects.<br><br>
Assuming you missed 2 days out of 7 days you booked for English language, you’ll read English for 
another 2 days after finishing with all subjects. That’s how you’ll do in the rest subjects if you missed a 
day or more from the weeks you booked for them. Is this clear? Though you may not be able to recover 
the days you have missed, just spend the days before the examination on the subjects you find difficult, 
or were unable to read well during your main schedule.<br><br>
READ YOUR FAVORITE SUBJECTS FIRST<br><br>
After structuring your timetable, make sure you read the subjects you understand very well before any 
other. This is because you can easily forget the subjects you find bored if read first. But by the time you
set to read these subjects after finishing the ones you understand or find interesting, the UTME won’t be 
more than two weeks so your memory will still be at a tendency to recall what you have read within the 
interval (Two weeks to the examination).<br><br>
➢ DEDICATE ENOUGH TIME TO READING AND STUDYING OF JAMB RECOMMENDED TEXTBOOKS <br><br>
Buy JAMB recommended textbooks for each of your subjects and dedicate your time to reading them. 
Never get tired of reading and studying of these books. You may not need to buy all the recommended 
books, just by like two for each subject. And use Google for the rest. You’ll see the recommended books 
for each subject at the last pages of their syllabus. <br><br>
The top scorers aren’t lazy that’s why they excel in their examinations. You can also become one of 
them if you can work like them. The tips and guidelines in this book are used by me and I can happily tell 
you that I excel in my UTME examination without attending any tutorial class. <br><br>
Even if a candidate attend a tutorial class he may still have low score if he doesn’t work hard. Hard work
is what make those you’re seeing at the top excel. The purpose of this long words of mine is to make 
you hopeful and work hard by dedicating your time to reading. You can do this! Don’t be lazy!!<br><br>
❖ Why Having Higher Scores In UTME and Post UTME is Good.<br><br>
Having higher scores in your examinations is good, especially when you are aspiring for an institution 
outside your state of origin. Or aspiring for a competitive course like Law or MBBS. The institution 
outside your state of origin will only offer you admission when you merit it, otherwise your course will 
be changed or denied admission totally. So, try scoring higher above your course cutoff marks to get 
higher chances of getting admitted into the University.
