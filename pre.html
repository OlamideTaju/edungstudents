   <h1>How to prepare for JAMB's UTME And Score Higher</h1>
   <hr>
<p>Every year, students seeking admissions into tertiary institutions in Nigeria are made to face an exam called UTME. This exam is organized and conducted by Joint Admission and Matriculation Board, JAMB.
<br><br>
However, this exam, as I find it easy to pass has been a major obstacle that prevents many students from getting into tertiary institutions, especially, the university - the first choice of every student. <br><br>

Many students have spent more than a year at home because of their failures in the UTME. They are still looking forward to write another one this year, 2022 with hope that they'll get it right one day. 
<br><br>
Let me sound it clearly to you that you'll only get solutions when you know the cause of a problem. For an instance, when you go to a hospital, the doctor that attends to you will firstly conduct a medical test on you, diagnoses and prescribes medicine for you after knowing the cause of your illness. Without knowing the cause (s), he can do nothing. The same thing applies to the UTME. You can't pass until you know your weakness and the causes of your failures in the exam. 
<br><br>
Even if you have not sat for the exam, this content will guide you in order to pass once and get into the university.
<br><br>
How to prepare for JAMB's UTME 2022? Let get started.
<br><br>
Before you choose a course of study, make enquiries about it. Do you have the capability to study it? Ask yourself some questions and make sure you get positive answers before purchasing the form.
<br><br>
What are the core subjects of your course of study? Every course has core subjects you must register during UTME/DE registration. Make sure you choose correct core subjects (subject combination) for your course to avoid disqualification even with higher marks.
<br><br>
Now, you have answered "yes" that you have the capability to study your course in the university. You have also known the course core subjects, and have consequently registered for the UTME. So, what next? How to pass the exam? Right!
<br><br>
It's easy to pass but some students are killed by over-confidence. They will proclaim it's "objective" then shun reading. At the end of the day, they will get low scores and blame JAMB for the misfortunes they brought themselves.
<br><br>
Never be part of these students. You can only pass an exam when you read. Don't be deceived. 
<br><br>
Back to discussion. How to pass JAMB's UTME?
<br><br>
1. Get UTME syllabus for your subjects.
<br><br>
JAMB releases syllabus for each subject to be written in the UTME every year. Try to get yours. There are recommended reading textbooks at the end of each syllabus. Try to get them. It's not a must to buy all. Just get some and use Google for the rest.
<br><br>
2. Set a timetable.
<br><br>
After getting the syllabus and the recommended reading textbooks, set a timetable for studying. Structure the timetable to your taste and read the books very well. Don't read outside syllabus! If at all you want to do so, make sure you have covered your syllabus.
<br><br>
4. Get some past questions.
<br><br>
This is not the most important as many students see it, but helps candidates to know how the questions are set. It also awakes candidates to know their weaknesses as it will trigger them to reading more when they are unable to answer some questions in it.
<br><br>
3. Prayer.
<br><br>
Prayer is very essential. Nothing can happen except by the will of God. Even if you read, you can still fail if God wishes. So, pray as you read. I believe you belong to a faith that says there is God.
<br><!--
I have written an eBook on how to pass the UTME, Admission Processing Into Tertiary Institutions in Nigeria. This book contains:
<br><br>
How JAMB processes admissons.
<br><br>
Introduction to JAMB's CAPS, meaning and functions.
<br><br>
How to either accept or reject admission when offered.

Who gives admissons? JAMB or Institution? Etc. 

If you're interested in the eBook click here to get yours. It's just 1k.-->

Looking forward to seeing you in the university.</p></div>
