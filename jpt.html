  <h1>
Who Gives Candidates Admissions? JAMB or Institutions?</h1>
<hr>
<p>
This question is common among candidates seeking admission into tertiary institutions. However, the 
answer to this question is that JAMB despite being the body responsible for processing of admissions 
into tertiary institutions in Nigeria can’t initiate admissions without recommendations from institutions. 
The institutions are the ones that give candidates admissions. They will pick the qualified ones and send 
them to Jamb for approval. This is when a candidate admission status will change to AIP on caps. The 
work of JAMB is to make sure a candidate given admission deserves it by meeting all admission 
requirements. When a candidate meets all the admission requirements, Jamb will give its approval and 
the status will finally change to admitted.<br><br>
Interpretation Of The Diagram Above: <br><br>
Institution Admission Officers are charged to propose qualified candidates and recommend them to the 
Head Of Institution, V.C, Rector, or Provost. The head of institution will send the recommendation to 
JAMB Desk. JAMB will approve the admissions and send them to recommended candidates. That’s when 
a candidate admission status on CAPS will change to ‘congratulations.”<br><br>
NOTE: When JAMB receives recommendation from institution, candidates recommended will see 
“Admission in progress check back later” as their admission status on CAPS. And when JAMB finally 
approves it, it will change to “congratulations…” and they will be asked to accept/reject the offers.<br><br>Understanding Caps: Meaning And How It Works<br><br>
CAPS is an acronym of Central Admission Processing System, launched by JAMB to eradicate admission 
corruption. Jamb admits any candidate seeking admission into a tertiary institution via this system. 
According to the body, a candidate’s admission is foiled if he isn’t admitted on caps but only on 
institution portal. So, before you rejoice over your admission, make sure you have been offered 
admission on caps, and printed your admission letter.<br><br>
Accessing Caps: How A Candidate Can Accept/Reject Admission Offer On 
Caps, Or Check Credentials (Step-By-Step Guide)
Below are step-by-step guides on how a candidate can access his Jamb’s caps to either accept/reject his 
admission offer or check credentials:<br><br>
1. Look for a good browser, the recommended ones by JAMB are Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.<br><br>
2. Open your browser and go to JAMB site, but before you login, click on the three dots if you’re
using Firefox(for Chrome it’s the same but sometimes turns to red) at the top right corner of 
your browser and select “Request desktop site” from the drop down. When the page pops up, 
enter your details and login.<br><br>
3. Click on the “Check Admission Status” on the popped up page.<br><br>
4. On the next page, enter your JAMB registration number, and click on “Access My Caps”, then it’ll 
take you to the last page.
On the last page, you’ll see different options, like: Check Admission Status, My O’level Result, etc. Just 
click on anyone you want prior to the operation you want to perform. If you click on “My O’level” to 
view your result and you can’t see it there, go for re-uploading.<br><br>
ALTERNATIVE:<br><br>
To ease accessing the CAPS, JAMB has created an app that perform this task. You can use this alternative 
if the first one is too long or difficult for you. The app name is “Caps Mobile”, you’ll find it on Google play 
store, download it and follow the prompts. </p></div><br>
